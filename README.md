This is a project to document going through [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-redux-react-counter-example)'s course on [redux](https://redux.js.org/). I started with a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then applied the content from the lessons into that application.
